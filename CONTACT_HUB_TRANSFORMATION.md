### Tablet (768px - 1024px)
- Single column stack
- CTA card full width

## 🎯 Strategic Reasoning (Why Option A Won)

### ✅ Advantages:
1. **No redundancy** - Single contact form (the popup)
2. **Keeps valuable info** - Collaboration types showcase your openness
3. **Better UX flow** - Clear call-to-action → popup
4. **Professional appearance** - Response time + social links
5. **Maintains popup value** - Popup remains special and deliberate
6. **Mobile friendly** - Less scrolling, clearer hierarchy

### ❌ What We Avoided:
- **Option B (Both forms):** User confusion, redundancy
- **Option C (Remove section):** Lost valuable information, direct jump to footer
- **Option D (Keep as-is):** Duplicate forms, unclear user journey
