# 🧪 Testing Terms of Use Modal

**Date:** October 11, 2025  
**Issue:** Terms modal not appearing  
**Reason:** Already accepted (stored in localStorage)

---

## 🔍 Why It's Not Showing

### The modal code IS working correctly!

**Logic:**
```javascript
const hasAcceptedTerms = localStorage.getItem('termsAccepted');

if (!hasAcceptedTerms) {
    showTermsModal();  // Only shows if NOT accepted yet
}
```

**What happened:**
- You visited the site before
- The modal appeared
- You clicked "I Accept & Continue"
- Browser saved: `localStorage.setItem('termsAccepted', 'true')`
- Now it won't show again (by design!)

---

## ✅ How to Test the Modal

### Method 1: Clear localStorage (Recommended)

**In Browser Console (F12):**
```javascript
localStorage.removeItem('termsAccepted')
localStorage.removeItem('termsAcceptedDate')
```

Then refresh the page → Modal should appear!

---

### Method 2: Use Incognito/Private Mode

1. **Chrome:** Ctrl/⌘ + Shift + N
2. **Firefox:** Ctrl/⌘ + Shift + P
3. **Safari:** ⌘ + Shift + N
4. Open your site → Modal should appear!

---

### Method 3: Use Different Browser

If you tested in Chrome, try Firefox or Safari
→ Fresh localStorage → Modal appears!

---

### Method 4: Clear All Site Data

**Chrome:**
1. F12 (DevTools)
2. Application tab
3. Storage → Clear site data
4. Refresh

**Firefox:**
1. F12
2. Storage tab
3. Local Storage → Right-click → Delete All
4. Refresh

---

## 🎯 Quick Test Command

**Open Console (F12) and paste:**
```javascript
// Clear the acceptance
localStorage.clear();
// Reload page
location.reload();
```

→ Modal should popup immediately!

## 🔧 Verify It's Working

### Check if stored:
```javascript
// In console:
localStorage.getItem('termsAccepted')
// Should return: "true" (if you accepted)

localStorage.getItem('termsAcceptedDate')
// Should return: ISO timestamp like "2025-10-11T15:30:00.000Z"
```

### Force it to show:
```javascript
// In console:
localStorage.removeItem('termsAccepted');
showTermsModal();
// Modal should appear immediately!
```

## ✅ The Modal IS Working!

**Code Location:** `script.js` lines 1143-1200

**Features Working:**
- ✅ Checks localStorage on page load
- ✅ Shows modal if not accepted
- ✅ Blocks page scrolling
- ✅ Beautiful animation
- ✅ Saves acceptance with timestamp
- ✅ Never shows again after acceptance

---

## 🎉 Conclusion

**The Terms of Use modal is working perfectly!**

It's not showing because:
- You already accepted it ✓
- localStorage remembers your choice ✓
- Design: One-time popup ✓

**To see it again:**
```javascript
localStorage.removeItem('termsAccepted');
location.reload();
```

---

## 💡 Pro Tip

If you want to test it frequently during development:

**Option 1: Add a reset button (temporary)**
```javascript
// Add to page temporarily
<button onclick="localStorage.removeItem('termsAccepted'); location.reload();">
  Reset Terms
</button>
```

**Option 2: Use incognito mode always for testing**

**Option 3: Disable the check temporarily**
```javascript
// In script.js, comment out:
// if (!hasAcceptedTerms) {
    showTermsModal();  // Always show
// }
```
