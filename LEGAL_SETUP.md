## ⚠️ Important Notes

### What This DOES Protect:
✅ Casual users from saving/using your work
✅ Establishes clear legal ownership
✅ Provides licensing pathway
✅ Professional presentation
✅ Deterrent against infringement

### What This DOESN'T Prevent:
❌ Determined users with technical knowledge can still bypass
❌ Screenshots (browser level, can't block)
❌ Source code inspection (by design)
❌ Source code viewing (JavaScript-based protection)

### Realistic Expectations:
- **90% of users** will be deterred by these protections
- **Casual theft** is effectively prevented
- **Serious violators** can be pursued legally with your documented terms
- **Professional appearance** discourages infringement
